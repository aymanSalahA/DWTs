# PHASE 01 — RAW DATA EXTRACTION & REPRESENTATION

This phase is **100% SELF-CONTAINED**. 

## Mission

Take ALL raw data from `inbox/` → Represent each data type properly → Reorder blocks → Output as Markdown + HTML

---

## ⛔ CONTENT RULES — ZERO EXCEPTIONS

### WHAT YOU DO:
✅ Read all files from `inbox/` folder (recursively)
✅ Collect every character, word, phrase, block exactly as written
✅ Represent each content type in its proper format (see below)
✅ Reorder blocks into a logical sequence (group related content)
✅ Output to `export/` as `.md` and `.html` files

### WHAT YOU NEVER DO:
❌ Fix typos — "projct" stays "projct"
❌ Fix grammar — "too the zou" stays "too the zou"
❌ Fix spelling — "zoo" typed as "zou" stays "zou"
❌ Add explanations, notes, or comments
❌ Interpret or translate content
❌ Add words that weren't in raw data
❌ Remove words that were in raw data

---

## 🔴 THE GOLDEN RULE

    INPUT: "too the zou go"
    OUTPUT: "go too the zou"

    ✅ CORRECT — Reordered, content preserved exactly
    ❌ WRONG — "go to the zoo" (fixed spelling = VIOLATION)

**If it wasn't in the raw data, it cannot be in the output.**
**If it had a typo in raw data, it has that typo in output.**

---

## 📊 DATA TYPE REPRESENTATION

Represent each content type in its proper format — but **content stays exactly as written**:

| Data Type | Representation | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **List items** | As markdown list (`-` or `1.`) | `- item one` |
| **Images** | As image embed | `![alt](path)` or `<img>` |
| **Links** | As markdown links | `[text](url)` |
| **Code/Commands** | As code blocks | ` ```bash ` |
| **Tables** | As markdown tables | `| col | col |` |
| **Quotes** | As blockquotes | `> quote text` |
| **Plain text** | As paragraphs | Normal text |

### Key Point:
The **content** inside stays EXACTLY as raw data.
Only the **representation** changes to proper format.

### Example:

**RAW INPUT:**
```
buy milk
buy bread  
npm instal pakage
```

**VALID OUTPUT:**
```markdown
- buy milk
- buy bread

```bash
npm instal pakage
```
```

Note: "instal" and "pakage" stay misspelled. But:
- List items become a proper list
- Command becomes a code block

---

## How Reordering Works

You MAY reorder blocks in this manner:

| Action | Allowed |
|--------|---------|
| Move entire blocks/fragments | ✅ YES |
| Group similar content together | ✅ YES |
| Sequence fragments logically | ✅ YES |
| Change word order within a sentence | ❌ NO |

---

## Output Requirements

1. **Markdown file** (`export/output.md`)
   - Contains all raw data, properly represented
   - Lists as lists, code as code blocks, images as embeds
   - Content preserved exactly (typos and all)

2. **HTML file** (`export/output.html`)
   - Same content rendered as HTML
   - Proper HTML elements for each data type
   - Bootstrap 5 styling for clean appearance

---

## Execution Flow

```
START
  ├─→ Read ALL files in inbox/ (including subdirectories)
  ├─→ Identify data types (list, code, image, text, etc.)
  ├─→ Represent each in proper format (content unchanged)
  ├─→ Determine logical order (by topic/relatedness)
  ├─→ Arrange blocks in that order
  ├─→ Write to export/output.md
  ├─→ Write to export/output.html
END
```

---

## Verification Checklist (Before Output)

Before producing output, verify:

- [ ] Every word in output exists in input (exact match)
- [ ] No words added that weren't in input
- [ ] No spelling corrections made
- [ ] No grammar corrections made
- [ ] Lists are rendered as proper lists
- [ ] Code/commands are in code blocks
- [ ] Images are properly embedded
- [ ] Links are properly formatted

## Phase Status

📍 **PHASE 01: RAW EXTRACTION**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Status: Ready to extract

When complete, output:
```
📍 PHASE 01: COMPLETE
✅ Extracted [N] items from [M] files
✅ Represented as proper data types
✅ Reordered into logical blocks
✅ Written to export/output.md
✅ Written to export/output.html
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Raw extraction complete. Content preserved exactly.
```

---

## This Phase Does NOT:

- Fix typos, spelling, or grammar
- Add explanatory notes
- Add words that weren't in source
- Ask for user input

**It is EXTRACT + REPRESENT + REORDER. Content stays exactly as written.**
