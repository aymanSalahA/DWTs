## 📈 Process Workflow

### Steps

| Step | Action                | Notes                          |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0    | Submit raw data       | Notes, drafts, references      |
| 1    | Order data            | **No text edits**              |
| 2    | Group & Label         | Minor header edits only        |
| 3    | Flag gaps             | Redundancies, unclear sections |
| 4    | Resolve issues        | **User Action Required**       |
| 5    | Approve final outline |                                |

### Rules

-   🔒 **Sequential**: No step proceeds until the current one is ~~explicityly~~ explicitly approved
-   ✍️ **Edits**: Only Step 2 allows edits — and only to headers/titles
-   ⏸️ **Pause**: Your progress is saved at the last completed step

### ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if user adds new data mid-process?**

> 🤖 Rule: User must complete current step before adding new data. New data loops back to Step 0.

## 💡 The Mind Chaos Problem

Solving the problem of scattered ideas across Notion, ~~obsedian~~ Obsidian, and Google Docs.

**The Core Issue**: When ideas, notes, and thoughts are scattered — you write a note, then screenshots, then a question, then another note... The challenge is organizing this chaos into something structured.

**Each use case needs a different output template/shape.**

---

## 📦 Use Cases

| #   | Use Case                 | Description                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Life Events / Memoir** | Remember events randomly (1994, 2011, 1995) → Organize into timeline |
| 2   | **Course Notes**         | Watch courses, write notes, capture questions, collect PDFs          |
| 3   | **Article Writing**      | Collect ideas, stories, and ~~eveything~~ everything related         |
| 4   | **CV / Resume**          | Keep ~~wriitng~~ writing things about career experiences             |

---

## 🔄 Phase Details

**Core Flow**: `Collect → Organize → Fix → Export`

### 📥 Phase 1: Collect (Raw Input)

Allow free input mode. Keep writing notes (small or big). Everything is saved **RAW, exactly as-is**. No touching until input phase is done.

### 📁 Phase 2: Organize & Fix

-   Group related pieces under titles/categories
-   Grouping keeps content RAW (not touched)
-   AI suggests fixes: ~~redundnt~~ redundant spaces, typos, duplicates
-   New edits have marks; raw data kept with strikethrough or highlight

### ✨ Final Phase: AI Enhancement

AI will add sections (like chapters in ~~Boosk~~ Books). AI content marked with icon (💡). AI can add suggestion links, answers below questions.

---

## ✅ Requirements

1. **Good Reference**: Files should be easy to view and search inside later
2. **Visual ~~represenation~~ Representation**: Use optimal format — todo list, checklist, graph, flowchart, embedded videos, image gallery, tables
3. **Output Format**: HTML? Markdown? 🤖 Both recommended

---

## 📝 Project Notes

| #   | Note                                                                          | Status      |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | Output is only text in readme — no checklists                                 | ⚠️ To Fix   |
| 2   | Need flowcharts and other ~~represetations~~ representations                  | 🔧 Feature  |
| 3   | Phases must be sequential. AI replies with ONE word ("~~Reveived~~ Received") | ✅ Rule     |
| 4   | Document title must be user-defined, not AI-generated                         | ✅ Rule     |
| 5   | ~~Anootation~~ Annotation, markup, bold/italic, second language (Arabic)      | 🔧 Feature  |
| 6   | Support for big files ("like a book") or collect later                        | ❓ Question |
| 7   | Images, media, and attachments support                                        | 🔧 Feature  |
| 8   | Code snippets as pretty images (like HydePHP)                                 | 🔧 Feature  |
| 9   | Remove duplicates later? Or keep?                                             | ❓ Question |

## 💙 Flutter Documentation Rules

_🤖 This appears to be a separate prompt for Flutter notes organization_

1. ✅ **Preserve** original content exactly as written
2. ✅ **Categorize** under: "Page Layout," "Navigation," "Stateful vs Stateless," "Questions/TODOs"
3. ✅ **Highlight** AI notes in yellow (🟡 AI Note: [clarification])
4. ✅ **Code** with syntax highlighting
5. ✅ **Output** as single ~~markown~~ Markdown file

## 💬 Communication Preference

**User Request:**

-   ~~Avoid excessive talk~~
-   Don't present things as "optimal solution"
-   Be brief and ~~consice~~ concise
-   Put pros and ~~COns~~ cons
-   Conversational style — not too short, not too long
