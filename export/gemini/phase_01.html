                <p>Now I want to create an Idea to Solving Mind Chaos Problem, Notion and obsedian and google docs exist
                    if we want to create a Document and we know what to write and how to organize , But For me there is
                    another issue , in some use Cases , the issue if the ideas or notes or thoughts are scattered
                    (Example :write Note ,then maybe some screenshots ,maybe after a While write question , maybe then
                    write another note , maybe after the note I get another question and understand and get the answer
                    for the first question I wrote )..etc</p>
                <p>Use cases are like :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1- lets imagine you remeber your life ,write Event at 1994 , then event at 2011 , then at 1995 ,
                        you just memorize them randomly , but then you want to write organized book about the events in
                        a certain timeline and Chapters with titles</li>
                    <li>2- watching a course and keep writing notes ,writing questions of things to search later,
                        putting some pdfs or templates or screenshots or cards for something ..etc</li>
                    <li>3- planning to write an article , and collecting ideas and stories and eveything related , till
                        it is ready to be an article</li>
                    <li>4- maybe also writing CV ? you keep wriitng things about the career ?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since we talked about different cases , each case need a different output file shape ( or in other
                    words , a template ), so also put this in consideration</p>
                <p>Here are some notes and questions and thoughts about this Idea including how I think the phases of
                    the project should be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1- First of all , As You can see my Thoughts even about this idea are scattered , So gathering
                        my ideas and making a file with all things in my mind about it is a use case</li>
                </ul>
                <p>PHASES are like this Collect → Organize → Fix → Export.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2- Phase 1 : The Idea first is to Allow free input mode, where i can keep writing small ( or big
                        notes ) , and those notes or even files and documents should be RAW , Not touched till this
                        input Phase is Done , so I keep feeding with my ideas and thoughts ...etc and they are saved
                        "Raw" , exactly as-is collecting first, Or phase 1 can be a file with info But I will inject new
                        Ideas/notes/data inside it</li>
                    <li>3- Phase 2 : Organizing and Fixing ,and this Has lots of steps , for example two pieces of info
                        one written at the begining or the collect phase and one written at end of collect phase , they
                        could be related and grouped under some title or category , so this phase include organizing and
                        categorization of notes and data and grouping them But this Grouping still keep them RAW and not
                        touched ,, then Comes the AI role , suggesting fixing ( for example redundnt spaces , or adding
                        spaces , or fixing a typo or even a phrase repeated twice and AI keep only one ) and ALthough AI
                        here is editing but the new edit should have some marks , and raw data should be kept ( maybe
                        with Linethought or highlight but kept ) till user agree on the new Edit</li>
                    <li>4- Final Phase ,is that AI will add sections ( like the sections in Boosk ) where there is
                        representation that this piece of paragpraph or whatever is AI ( maybe a lamp icon at the
                        beginnning) Where AI can put links for suggestions or answers below questions or whatever</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Notes and Things I want it for :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1- The files created should be good as a reference later If i need , easy to view and search
                        inside</li>
                    <li>2- The Visual represenation is very important , representing Things I write into the Correct and
                        best representaiton , Maybe data are better as todo list or checklist ,or represented as a Graph
                        or flowchart or Videos to be emdedded or image gallery or tables, and this is related to the
                        "tempalte" idea</li>
                </ul>
                <p>3-Since I talked about the reprensation , better to be html ? or markdown ? or what ???? i dont know
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A - question 1: is there something exist ( app or whatever ) to do so ?</li>
                    <li>B - question 2 : What is Best AI model to do so ? or all are equal ?</li>
                    <li>C - question 3 : what is best option to cover those requiremetns ? coded project , Agent or
                        custom GPT , a CLI ?,Or creating a punch of prompts in a Folder and each time take those prompts
                        in a new folder and open it with AI editor and put things ( files and write notes in files and
                        put images and media ...etc )then make the Editor agent organize them ?</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>1- the shape of the output is only text in readme , no checklists even if it is better to
                        represent it the todo list shape</li>
                    <li>2- Well , since we talk about shapes , what about flow charts and other represetations too ?
                    </li>
                    <li>3- I want those Phases "Collect → Organize → Fix → Export." Not escpaed , It is sequenctial one
                        by one , no skipp unless unders some rules "fixing by AI for example " ,, Also for each phase AI
                        reply with ONLY one word , so if in Collect , it always hint that it is in collected mode or if
                        receive data it says "Reveived" Not bla bla at all</li>
                    <li>4- Before anything, there is a need to know the title of the document , not AI making it up</li>
                    <li>5- Anootation , or markup and making something bold or italic , or second langage in doc like
                        Arabic too</li>
                    <li>6- Also if I want to make big file "that is like a book" will it be possible , or collect them
                        later ?</li>
                    <li>7-images , media and attachments</li>
                    <li>8-Code snippets , need them in pretty image like the ones in HydePHP</li>
                    <li>9-also need to remove duplicates later ?? Or keep it ?</li>
                </ul>

                        "Questions/TODOs."</li>

                    <li>4. For code, use syntax highlighting.</li>
                    <li>5. Output: Generate both **Markdown**. only one markown that I can copy , the markdown include
