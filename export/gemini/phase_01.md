## 🤖 [AI Title] Submission Flow

0 — Submit raw data
1 — Order data (no text edits)
2 — Group and label (minor header edits only)
3 — Flag gaps, redundancies, unclear sections
4 — Resolve all flagged issues (user action required)
5 — Approve final outline

## 🤖 [AI Title] Step Rules

No step proceeds until current step is explicitly approved
Only Step 2 allows minor edits (headers/titles only)
Raw content untouched in Steps 0, 1, 3, 4, 5

🔒 No step proceeds until the current one is fully done and approved.
✍️ Only Step 2 allows edits — and only to headers/titles (e.g., shorten, clarify). All body text stays 100% original everywhere else.
🚩 Step 4 flags must be resolved by you — no auto-fixing by me. If something’s missing or unclear, I’ll stop and wait for your input.
⏸️ Pause anytime. Resume later — your progress is saved at the last completed step.

## 🤖 [AI Title] Process Q&A

Ok, What if after generating final data , user added new piece of Raw info, should we restart ? what if user wrote raw info in middle of process

## 🤖 [AI Title] Project Phases Draft

---

0- user raw data (notes, bullet points, drafts, references, etc.).
1-order data /Suggest a logical flow (e.g., introduction → background → key points → conclusion), all letters/characters are untouched at all
2-Categorize and group related ideas./ add labels and titles and headers (minor edits in titles and category)
3- Flag gaps, redundancies, or unclear sections for your review.
4- Present the ordered outline ( final draft) for approval .

NOTE : USER CANT PROCEDD to next metro step unless finish the PREV step-------------

## 🤖 [AI Title] Instructions to Agent

I will give you scattered peices of Information , that need to be organized and then you you give me the final Output ,,

Step one is that you get information and order them in best order

after that I will walk you till we get final pdf file ( I will tell you each step what is required in this phase)

important note, keep my raw data till I ask you to add or remove something

## 🤖 [AI Title] Flowchart

Collect → Organize → Fix → Export.( If I give wrong order it should be aware)

---

## 🤖 [AI Title] Notes List

after making the agents , and still have to try other models , but here is the Notes :
1- the shape of the output is only text in readme , no checklists even if it is better to represent it the todo list shape
2- Well , since we talk about shapes , what about flow charts and other represetations too ?
3- I want those Phases "Collect → Organize → Fix → Export." Not escpaed , It is sequenctial one by one , no skipp unless unders some rules "fixing by AI for example " ,, Also for each phase AI reply with ONLY one word , so if in Collect , it always hint that it is in collected mode or if receive data it says "Reveived" Not bla bla at all
4- Before anything, there is a need to know the title of the document , not AI making it up
5- Anootation , or markup and making something bold or italic , or second langage in doc like Arabic too
6- Also if I want to make big file "that is like a book" will it be possible , or collect them later ?
7-images , media and attachments
8-Code snippets , need them in pretty image like the ones in HydePHP
9-also need to remove duplicates later ?? Or keep it ?

## 🤖 [AI Title] Flutter Prompt

Organize my Flutter notes (text, code, images, todos) into a structured document. Follow these rules:

1. Preserve my original content exactly as written.
2. Categorize under headings: "Page Layout," "Navigation," "Stateful vs Stateless," "Questions/TODOs."
3. Highlight AI notes/suggestions in yellow (e.g., "🟡 AI Note: [clarification]").
4. For code, use syntax highlighting.
5. Output: Generate both **Markdown**. only one markown that I can copy , the markdown include everything in one shot

## 🤖 [AI Title] Core Idea

Now I want to create an Idea to Solving Mind Chaos Problem, Notion and obsedian and google docs exist if we want to create a Document and we know what to write and how to organize , But For me there is another issue , in some use Cases , the issue if the ideas or notes or thoughts are scattered (Example :write Note ,then maybe some screenshots ,maybe after a While write question , maybe then write another note , maybe after the note I get another question and understand and get the answer for the first question I wrote )..etc

## 🤖 [AI Title] Use Cases

Use cases are like : 
1- lets imagine you remeber your life ,write Event at 1994 , then event at 2011 , then at 1995 , you just memorize them randomly , but then you want to write organized book about the events in a certain timeline and Chapters with titles

2- watching a course and keep writing notes ,writing questions of things to search later, putting some pdfs or templates or screenshots or cards for something ..etc

3- planning to write an article , and collecting ideas and stories and eveything related , till it is ready to be an article

4- maybe also writing CV ? you keep wriitng things about the career ?

## 🤖 [AI Title] Output Shape

Since we talked about different cases , each case need a different output file shape ( or in other words , a template ), so also put this in consideration

## 🤖 [AI Title] Project Phases Thoughts

Here are some notes and questions and thoughts about this Idea including how I think the phases of the project should be: 
1- First of all , As You can see my Thoughts even about this idea are scattered , So gathering my ideas and making a file with all things in my mind about it is a use case

PHASES are like this Collect → Organize → Fix → Export.

## 🤖 [AI Title] Phase 1 Idea

2- Phase 1 : The Idea first is to Allow free input mode, where i can keep writing small ( or big notes ) , and those notes or even files and documents should be RAW , Not touched till this input Phase is Done , so I keep feeding with my ideas and thoughts ...etc and they are saved "Raw" , exactly as-is collecting first, Or phase 1 can be a file with info But I will inject new Ideas/notes/data inside it

## 🤖 [AI Title] Phase 2 Idea

3- Phase 2 : Organizing and Fixing ,and this Has lots of steps , for example two pieces of info one written at the begining or the collect phase and one written at end of collect phase , they could be related and grouped under some title or category , so this phase include organizing and categorization of notes and data and grouping them But this Grouping still keep them RAW and not touched ,, then Comes the AI role , suggesting fixing ( for example redundnt spaces , or adding spaces , or fixing a typo or even a phrase repeated twice and AI keep only one ) and ALthough AI here is editing but the new edit should have some marks , and raw data should be kept ( maybe with Linethought or highlight but kept ) till user agree on the new Edit

## 🤖 [AI Title] Phase 3 Idea

4- Final Phase ,is that AI will add sections ( like the sections in Boosk ) where there is representation that this piece of paragpraph or whatever is AI ( maybe a lamp icon at the beginnning) Where AI can put links for suggestions or answers below questions or whatever

## 🤖 [AI Title] Requirements

Notes and Things I want it for : 
1- The files created should be good as a reference later If i need , easy to view and search inside
2- The Visual represenation is very important , representing Things I write into the Correct and best representaiton , Maybe data are better as todo list or checklist ,or represented as a Graph or flowchart or Videos to be emdedded or image gallery or tables, and this is related to the "tempalte" idea

3-Since I talked about the reprensation , better to be html ? or markdown ? or what ???? i dont know

## 🤖 [AI Title] Questions

A - question 1: is there something exist ( app or whatever ) to do so ?
B - question 2 : What is Best AI model to do so ? or all are equal ? 
C - question 3 : what is best option to cover those requiremetns ? coded project ,  Agent or custom GPT , a CLI ?,Or creating a punch of prompts in a Folder and each time take those prompts in a new folder and open it with AI editor and put things ( files and write notes in files and put images and media ...etc )then make the Editor agent organize them ?

## 🤖 [AI Title] Communication Style

Please Avoid Shitty talk and talking so much , or making something as optimal solution , if you say something be brief and consice and Put pros and COns , I hate talking so much and I want it as a Conversation between me and a person so when asking make the reponse not too short nor too long
