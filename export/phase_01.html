                No step proceeds until current step is explicitly approved

                Raw content untouched in Steps 0, 1, 3, 4, 5


                🔒 No step proceeds until the current one is fully done and approved.
                ✍️ Only Step 2 allows edits — and only to headers/titles (e.g., shorten, clarify). All body text stays
                100% original everywhere else.
                🚩 Step 4 flags must be resolved by you — no auto-fixing by me. If something’s missing or unclear, I’ll
                stop and wait for your input.
                ⏸️ Pause anytime. Resume later — your progress is saved at the last completed step.

                after making the agents , and still have to try other models , but here is the Notes :
                1- the shape of the output is only text in readme , no checklists even if it is better to represent it
                the todo list shape
                2- Well , since we talk about shapes , what about flow charts and other represetations too ?
                3- I want those Phases "Collect → Organize → Fix → Export." Not escpaed , It is sequenctial one by one ,
                no skipp unless unders some rules "fixing by AI for example " ,, Also for each phase AI reply with ONLY
                one word , so if in Collect , it always hint that it is in collected mode or if receive data it says
                "Reveived" Not bla bla at all
                4- Before anything, there is a need to know the title of the document , not AI making it up
                5- Anootation , or markup and making something bold or italic , or second langage in doc like Arabic too
                6- Also if I want to make big file "that is like a book" will it be possible , or collect them later ?
                7-images , media and attachments
                8-Code snippets , need them in pretty image like the ones in HydePHP
                9-also need to remove duplicates later ?? Or keep it ?

                Note ,then maybe some screenshots ,maybe after a While write question , maybe then write another note ,
                maybe after the note I get another question and understand and get the answer for the first question I

                just memorize them randomly , but then you want to write organized book about the events in a certain
                timeline and Chapters with titles 

                2- watching a course and keep writing notes ,writing questions of things to search later, putting some
                pdfs or templates or screenshots or cards for something ..etc 

                3- planning to write an article , and collecting ideas and stories and eveything related , till it is
                ready to be an article

                PHASES are like this Collect → Organize → Fix → Export.

                , and those notes or even files and documents should be RAW , Not touched till this input Phase is Done
                , so I keep feeding with my ideas and thoughts ...etc and they are saved "Raw" , exactly as-is
                collecting first, Or phase 1 can be a file with info But I will inject new Ideas/notes/data inside it

                3- Phase 2 : Organizing and Fixing ,and this Has lots of steps , for example two pieces of info one
                written at the begining or the collect phase and one written at end of collect phase , they could be
                related and grouped under some title or category , so this phase include organizing and categorization
                of notes and data and grouping them But this Grouping still keep them RAW and not touched ,, then Comes
                the AI role , suggesting fixing ( for example redundnt spaces , or adding spaces , or fixing a typo or
                even a phrase repeated twice and AI keep only one ) and ALthough AI here is editing but the new edit
                should have some marks , and raw data should be kept ( maybe with Linethought or highlight but kept )

                2- The Visual represenation is very important , representing Things I write into the Correct and best
                representaiton , Maybe data are better as todo list or checklist ,or represented as a Graph or flowchart
                or Videos to be emdedded or image gallery or tables, and this is related to the "tempalte" idea 

                3-Since I talked about the reprensation , better to be html ? or markdown ? or what ???? i dont know
