Now I want to create an Idea to Solving Mind Chaos Problem, Notion and obsedian and google docs exist if we want to create a Document and we know what to write and how to organize , But For me there is another issue , in some use Cases , the issue if the ideas or notes or thoughts are scattered (Example :write Note ,then maybe some screenshots ,maybe after a While write question , maybe then write another note , maybe after the note I get another question and understand and get the answer for the first question I wrote )..etc 

Use cases are like : 
1- lets imagine you remeber your life ,write Event at 1994 , then event at 2011 , then at 1995 , you just memorize them randomly , but then you want to write organized book about the events in a certain timeline and Chapters with titles 

2- watching a course and keep writing notes ,writing questions of things to search later, putting some pdfs or templates or screenshots or cards for something ..etc 

3- planning to write an article , and collecting ideas and stories and eveything related , till it is ready to be an article 

4- maybe also writing CV ? you keep wriitng things about the career ? 


Since we talked about different cases , each case need a different output file shape ( or in other words , a template ), so also put this in consideration 


Here are some notes and questions and thoughts about this Idea including how I think the phases of the project should be: 
1- First of all , As You can see my Thoughts even about this idea are scattered , So gathering my ideas and making a file with all things in my mind about it is a use case 

PHASES are like this Collect → Organize → Fix → Export.

2- Phase 1 : The Idea first is to Allow free input mode, where i can keep writing small ( or big notes ) , and those notes or even files and documents should be RAW , Not touched till this input Phase is Done , so I keep feeding with my ideas and thoughts ...etc and they are saved "Raw" , exactly as-is collecting first, Or phase 1 can be a file with info But I will inject new Ideas/notes/data inside it 

3- Phase 2 : Organizing and Fixing ,and this Has lots of steps , for example two pieces of info one written at the begining or the collect phase and one written at end of collect phase , they could be related and grouped under some title or category , so this phase include organizing and categorization of notes and data and grouping them But this Grouping still keep them RAW and not touched ,, then Comes the AI role , suggesting fixing ( for example redundnt spaces , or adding spaces , or fixing a typo or even a phrase repeated twice and AI keep only one ) and ALthough AI here is editing but the new edit should have some marks , and raw data should be kept ( maybe with Linethought or highlight but kept ) till user agree on the new Edit 

4- Final Phase ,is that AI will add sections ( like the sections in Boosk ) where there is representation that this piece of paragpraph or whatever is AI ( maybe a lamp icon at the beginnning) Where AI can put links for suggestions or answers below questions or whatever  


Notes and Things I want it for : 
1- The files created should be good as a reference later If i need , easy to view and search inside
2- The Visual represenation is very important , representing Things I write into the Correct and best representaiton , Maybe data are better as todo list or checklist ,or represented as a Graph or flowchart or Videos to be emdedded or image gallery or tables, and this is related to the "tempalte" idea 

3-Since I talked about the reprensation , better to be html ? or markdown ? or what ???? i dont know 

A - question 1: is there something exist ( app or whatever ) to do so ?
B - question 2 : What is Best AI model to do so ? or all are equal ? 
C - question 3 : what is best option to cover those requiremetns ? coded project ,  Agent or custom GPT , a CLI ?,Or creating a punch of prompts in a Folder and each time take those prompts in a new folder and open it with AI editor and put things ( files and write notes in files and put images and media ...etc )then make the Editor agent organize them ? 


Please Avoid Shitty talk and talking so much , or making something as optimal solution , if you say something be brief and consice and Put pros and COns , I hate talking so much and I want it as a Conversation between me and a person so when asking make the reponse not too short nor too long
